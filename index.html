        <h2 class="highlight">About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I have over 15 years of experience in administration, accounting, and financial management. Throughout my career, 
            I have developed strong skills in financial analysis, cash flow management, and strategic planning. After completing 
            a bootcamp in AI and Data Analytics, I am now applying advanced data techniques to enhance decision-making and optimize 
            financial strategies. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Applied Data Science, integrating my extensive management 
            experience with cutting-edge technical skills to drive innovation at the intersection of finance and AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems and improve business strategies. My experience 
            in accounting and finance has provided me with a strong foundation in working with complex data, while my recent 
            training in data science has given me the technical skills to approach problems from a data-driven perspective.

    <div id="experience" class="section">
        <h2 class="highlight">Relevant Experience</h2>
        <p>
            Over the years, I have built a strong foundation in financial analysis and management, particularly in the field of accounting. 
            As an **analyst** in various roles, I was responsible for processing, managing, and interpreting financial data to generate reports 
            that helped guide strategic business decisions. My expertise in **accounting and financial control** has provided me with a deep 
            understanding of financial statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and break-even analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an **analytical accountant**, I worked extensively with **financial data management**, overseeing tasks such as cash flow 
            analysis, financial forecasting, and tax preparation. My role required me to collaborate with internal teams to ensure that all 
            financial reports were accurate and up-to-date, allowing for better financial planning and resource allocation. I also played a key 
            role in managing accounts payable and receivable, billing, and dealing with suppliers and external auditors. Through these tasks, 
            I honed my ability to handle large sets of financial data, analyze trends, and make data-driven recommendations for improving business 
            operations and financial efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year, I made the decision to pivot my career towards **Data Science** and **AI**. I completed a bootcamp in **Data Analytics 
            and AI**, where I developed a solid understanding of **data manipulation, machine learning, deep learning**, and **data visualization**. 
            During the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience with programming languages like **Python** and libraries such as **Pandas, 
            NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn**, which helped me build models for prediction, classification, and regression tasks.
