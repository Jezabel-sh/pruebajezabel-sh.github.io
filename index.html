            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I have over 15 years of experience in administration, accounting, and financial management. Throughout my career, 
                I have developed strong skills in financial analysis, cash flow management, and strategic planning. After completing 
                a bootcamp in AI and Data Analytics, I am now applying advanced data techniques to enhance decision-making and optimize 
                financial strategies. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Applied Data Science, integrating my extensive management 
                experience with cutting-edge technical skills to drive innovation at the intersection of finance and AI.

            <h2>Relevant Experience</h2>
            
            <p>
                Over the years, I have built a strong foundation in financial analysis and management, particularly in the field of accounting. 
                As an **analyst** in various roles, I was responsible for processing, managing, and interpreting financial data to generate reports 
                that helped guide strategic business decisions. My expertise in **accounting and financial control** has provided me with a deep 
                understanding of financial statements, balance sheets, cash flows, and break-even analysis.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As an **analytical accountant**, I worked extensively with **financial data management**, overseeing tasks such as cash flow 
                analysis, financial forecasting, and tax preparation. My role required me to collaborate with internal teams to ensure that all 
                financial reports were accurate and up-to-date, allowing for better financial planning and resource allocation. I also played a key 
                role in managing accounts payable and receivable, billing, and dealing with suppliers and external auditors. Through these tasks, 
                I honed my ability to handle large sets of financial data, analyze trends, and make data-driven recommendations for improving business 
                operations and financial efficiency.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Working in **financial analysis**, I was able to apply critical thinking and **problem-solving skills** to assess financial risks, 
                identify cost-saving opportunities, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards. While my experience was primarily in the 
                accounting sector, I was exposed to data tools like Excel, SQL, and various accounting software, which sparked my interest in 
                leveraging **data analytics** to enhance financial decision-making and optimize business strategies.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                This year, I made the decision to pivot my career towards **Data Science** and **AI**. I completed a bootcamp in **Data Analytics 
                and AI**, where I developed a solid understanding of **data manipulation, machine learning, deep learning**, and **data visualization**. 
                During the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience with programming languages like **Python** and libraries such as **Pandas, 
                NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn**, which helped me build models for prediction, classification, and regression tasks.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The bootcamp taught me how to approach **real-world business problems** with data. I applied machine learning algorithms to 
                projects such as **credit risk prediction** and **waste classification using deep learning**. These experiences allowed me to 
                understand the end-to-end process of **data collection, cleaning, exploration**, and **model deployment**. I also learned how 
                to improve model accuracy through techniques like **feature engineering** and **fine-tuning**.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Additionally, the bootcamp provided me with a deep dive into **business intelligence tools** like **Google Looker** and **Power BI**, 
                which helped me visualize data insights and present them effectively. Combining my **financial background** with the skills learned 
                in the bootcamp, I am now equipped to analyze large datasets, build predictive models, and provide actionable insights to improve 
                business decision-making processes.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                I am excited to bring my **analytical mindset** and **technical expertise** to new challenges in the field of **Data Science** and **AI**.
